## Jets Project
##
For the Jets project I began by creating a Jet superclass Because I had to create multiple subclasses of jet. After Creating the Jet superclass I extended the Jet class to create 3 subclasses of jet called Cargo, FighterJet and passenger Jet.

##
After creating the 3 subclasses of Jet i created 3 interfaces classes to implement different types of interface methods depending on the type of Jet that is created.

##
After creating the superclass, the subclass and the interfaces the next aspect of the project to work o was the 'AirField'. The airfield is where not only where the Jets are "Stored" but it also where they are created. In the jet.txt files the buffered reader that was created in the 'Airfield' read through the jet.txt to create the jets and add them to the array

##
This is where i ran into issues...I was able to create all the methods to the best of my abilities but i am not able to get the values within the ArrayList of jets created to pass into the methods.

##
I was able to print off the jets so i know the BufferedReader is working and adding jets to the arraylist but i cannot figure out to get the values of the arraylist to run through the for loop for each method and print off the values.

##
Although i was unable to get my methods to work i moved on to create my menu list within the 'JetsApplication'. The jet application holds the main method to print off the results of the user choice. It also holds the prompt menu for the user.

##
Need to figure out how to get my arraylist value into my method to see if they work the way i intended.

##
Alot to do in regards to the small details of the program but the major stuff is done.
